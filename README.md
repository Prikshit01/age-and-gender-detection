Workflow of Age Detection System:

Face Detection: Detect faces in the input image or video using algorithms like Haar Cascades, SSD, or MTCNN.

Feature Extraction: Extract facial landmarks or the entire face image to feed into the model.

Model Prediction: Use a deep learning model (e.g., CNN) to predict the age of the person based on the facial features.

Post-processing: The model output is typically a single value or a range (like age groups), which is then processed and displayed.
